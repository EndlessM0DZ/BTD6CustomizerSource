Thank you for downloading!
This project was created by Ty Morrison aka Endless#1418
special thanks to BowDown097, Danny Parker, and Pro Gamer HD
BowDown097 Helped with Suggestions
I used Danny Parker's Steam Directory Finder/Game Directory Finder
Pro Gamer HD helped make the auto updater for the few mods that are in experimental and changing speed from a modified speed file.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Info:
	You must extract the file and keep them together! Make sure you have a non-modified GameAssembly.dll in the Game Directory the first
	time you open this program and the first time you open this program after any update to the game. You can make sure of this by 'verifying
	the integrity of your gamefiles'. First person to figure out how to get Shrek as their background gets a cookie.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
	This tool can be used as a BTD6 game launcher for dll mods. You can save the file or just overwrite to the Game Directory. It currently has 4 auto updated mods including Speedhack, Unlimited tier 5, place anywhere, and no cooldown. Also if the program detects a speedhack
	it will load the current value that the speedhack makes and will ask you if you want it changed in both saving and loading the game.
